Project: Criminal Incidents in DC

For my Project I plan to work with data that contains criminal incidents in DC. The data is located at http://opendata.dc.gov. The tables can be downloaded either as a Spreadsheet, KML, Shapefile and/or via API. I will be using the tables: Crime Incidents 2012.csv, Crime Incidents 2013.csv and Crime Incidents 2014.
The data contains: shifts(time of the day), dates, method, offense, wards, block add, etc.

I would like to answer the question: Can we predict the total number of expected aussault in DC?

The reason to why I choose this data set ist that crime is something that sparks my interest.  I want to see the trend and determine if the future will be better or if it will turn for the worst
